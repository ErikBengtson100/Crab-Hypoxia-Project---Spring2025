# Project Synopsis
This study sought to determine the effects of chronic hypoxia on crabs in deep and shallow water, using _Hemigrapsus oregonensis_ as a model organism. The effects of hypoxia on crabs are especially relevant because of the crashing commercially important snow crab (_Chionoecetes opilio_) and Dungeness crab (_Metacarcinus magister_) stocks in the Northeast Pacific. We hypothesized that chronic hypoxia would lead to increased hemolymph lactate concentration, decreased respiration rate, and gill atrophy. Three treatments were used: (i) control tank with high oxygen, (ii) a deep water hypoxia tank with low O2 and vacuum sealed to prevent O2 diffusion, and (iii) a shallow water hypoxia with low O2 and a mesh ladder to allow crabs access to the surface. The crabs' respiration rate was tested with resazurin after one week. After two weeks, the respiration rate was tested again, along with hemolymph lactate concentration, and crabs were euthanized and dissected to determine gill condition. There was a 100% mortality due to deep water hypoxia after two weeks. Both hypoxia treatments showed a significant increase in respiration rates, possibly explained by the need to pass more water over the gills due to the lower DO2. There was also a significant decrease in lactate, possibly due to the lactate paradox, previously only described in humans.
